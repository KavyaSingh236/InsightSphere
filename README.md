# 🤖 InsightSphere - Let your dataset tell its story.

InsightSphere is an intelligent data diagnostics platform that transforms raw datasets into
clear narratives, visual intelligence, and executive-ready insights — automatically.

Built as a multi-agent AI system, InsightSphere removes the friction between data and decision-making.
Users simply upload a dataset, and the system autonomously interprets structure, patterns, performance,
and implications — delivering a polished analytical report without manual configuration.

## ✨ Why InsightSphere Exists

Modern organizations sit on vast amounts of data, but extracting meaning still requires
technical expertise, time, and repeated effort.

InsightSphere addresses this gap by acting as an **autonomous analytical layer** —
bridging raw data and human understanding.

It is designed for:
- Decision-makers who need clarity, not code
- Analysts who want faster insight cycles
- Teams that value explainability over black-box outputs

## 🧠 Agent-Based Architecture

InsightSphere operates using a coordinated multi-agent system. Each agent is responsible for a distinct stage of the analytical lifecycle.

| Agent Name        | Responsibility |
|------------------|----------------|
| **DataAgent**     | Cleans, structures, and prepares the dataset for analysis |
| **TargetAgent**   | Uses AI reasoning to infer the most suitable target variable |
| **FeatureAgent**  | Examines feature relationships and correlations |
| **ModelAgent**    | Trains and compares multiple predictive models |
| **EvaluationAgent** | Evaluates model performance using standard metrics |
| **InsightAgent**  | Generates human-readable, data-driven explanations |
| **ReportAgent**   | Compiles insights, visuals, and narratives into a premium PDF |

The system adapts dynamically to each dataset — no predefined rules, no fixed schemas.
